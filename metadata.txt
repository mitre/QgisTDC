description=QGIS Time Data Control (QTDC):  A plugin for animating time-tagged data
version=v20220707
author=MITRE
email=qtdc@mitre.org

about=
    QTDC adds an interactive data animation capability to QGIS for vector layers having a time attribute. 
    
    The user can interactively control animation and specify the animation time context, 
    specifically: when in time, how much time, and how fast to animate the time-tagged data.
    
    Multiple layers can be animated with QTDC simultaneously.
    
    The UI also provides a histogram representation of data volume over time for each loaded layer. 
    
    The histogram doubles as a control for adjusting where in time and how much time to display.
    
    Animation is bi-directional and is controlled either with UI buttons or with mouse gestures on the histogram.
    
    There is also a basic API that exposes a subset of QTDC operations for interaction with other plugins.
